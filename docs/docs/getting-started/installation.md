# Installation

ShojiWM installs from source with a single script, `dist/install.sh`. It builds
everything, installs the compositor and its TypeScript runtime, drops in a
default user config, and registers a Wayland session so ShojiWM shows up in your
login manager.

:::info[Packaged installs are coming]
Distribution packages (AUR and similar) are planned for **just before the
official release**. Until then, install from source as described below.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system with a working Wayland / DRM setup
- A recent Rust toolchain (`cargo`)
- The following native libraries (with their development headers), which ShojiWM
  links against:
  - `libwayland`
  - `libxkbcommon`
  - `libudev`
  - `libinput`
  - `libgbm`
  - `libseat`
  - `libxcb` and `xcb-util-cursor` — used by the built-in xwayland-satellite
  - `xwayland` — the Xwayland server itself, for X11 applications (see the note
    below)
- `sudo` — the installer copies files into `/usr` and registers the session

:::note[Installing the native libraries]
Package names vary by distribution. For example:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libudev-dev libinput-dev \
  libgbm-dev libseat-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-cursor-dev xwayland

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S wayland libxkbcommon systemd-libs libinput mesa seatd libxcb \
  xcb-util-cursor xorg-xwayland
```

:::

:::note[X11 applications]
ShojiWM runs X11 applications through
[`xwayland-satellite`](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite), which is
built into ShojiWM: it uses the ShojiWM-specific fork on the `shojiwm` branch of
[`bea4dev/xwayland-satellite`](https://github.com/bea4dev/xwayland-satellite/tree/shojiwm)
and runs inside the compositor, so there is nothing to install besides
`xwayland`. If Xwayland stops, ShojiWM restarts it on the same `DISPLAY`.

For debugging, a separately installed `xwayland-satellite` can be run as its own
process instead:

| Environment variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SHOJI_XWAYLAND_SATELLITE=external` | run the `xwayland-satellite` found in `PATH` |
| `SHOJI_XWAYLAND_SATELLITE_PATH=/path/to/xwayland-satellite` | run that binary (also `--xwayland-satellite-path`) |
| `SHOJI_XWAYLAND_SATELLITE=off` | use Smithay's built-in Xwayland support instead of xwayland-satellite |
:::

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bea4dev/ShojiWM.git
cd ShojiWM
./dist/install.sh
```

The script will prompt for `sudo` when it needs to copy files into system
directories. It performs the following:

- **Builds** the compositor and the xdg-desktop-portal backend with `cargo`.
- Embeds the Deno/V8 TypeScript engine into the compositor through RustyScript;
  Node.js is not required at runtime.
- Installs the compositor to `/usr/bin/shoji_wm` and the runtime to
  `/usr/lib/shojiwm`.
- Creates a **default user config** at `~/.config/shojiwm` (an existing config is
  left untouched).
- Registers a **Wayland session entry**, so **ShojiWM appears in your login
  manager** — just pick it on the login screen.
- Installs the ShojiWM **xdg-desktop-portal** backend (screen casting, etc.).

### Install options

| Flag          | Effect                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--no-build`  | Skip the `cargo` build and use existing binaries |
| `--no-portal` | Don't install the xdg-desktop-portal backend     |
| `--no-config` | Don't create or update the user config           |

Run `./dist/install.sh --help` to see this list.

## NixOS / flakes

ShojiWM also provides an experimental Nix flake. The flake is intended to keep
the same split as the source installer:

- the compositor, portal backend, embedded Deno/V8 engine, and TypeScript
  runtime sources live in the Nix store
- your editable TypeScript config lives in `~/.config/shojiwm`
- development still uses `--dev` and the source tree directly

Node.js is not part of the installed compositor runtime. Nix downloads the
versioned `rusty_v8` archive as a fixed-output dependency while building
ShojiWM, then links it into the compositor binary.

:::warning[Experimental]
The NixOS support is new. Expect rough edges and check the latest repository
state before relying on it for a daily-driver system.
:::

### NixOS module (install)

Add ShojiWM as a flake input:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    shojiwm.url = "github:bea4dev/ShojiWM";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, shojiwm, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        shojiwm.nixosModules.default
        {
          programs.shojiwm = {
            enable = true;
            initConfig = {
              enable = true;
              users = [ "your-user" ];
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Then apply your system configuration:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#your-host
```

The module installs:

- the `shoji_wm` compositor
- `xdg-desktop-portal-shojiwm`
- the Wayland session entry for display managers
- the ShojiWM portal preference for screen capture

With `programs.shojiwm.initConfig.enable = true`, the module also initializes
the ShojiWM TypeScript config directory for the listed users during system
activation. It copies the default config only when `src/index.tsx` does not
exist yet. Existing user config files such as `src/index.tsx` and
`src/window-manager.ts` are kept. The generated support files are refreshed on
every rebuild:

- `node_modules/shoji_wm`, linked to the current Nix store TypeScript package
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`

These files keep editor diagnostics and standalone TypeScript type checking in
sync with the installed ShojiWM version. They are not Node runtime
dependencies: the compositor resolves and transpiles the config through its
embedded RustyScript/Deno runtime.

If you do not want the NixOS module to manage the config directory, omit
`initConfig` and initialize the editable TypeScript config manually:

```bash
nix run github:bea4dev/ShojiWM#init-config
```

This creates `~/.config/shojiwm` if it does not already exist, and links
`~/.config/shojiwm/node_modules/shoji_wm` to the package in the Nix store. Your
config remains writable and can still be hot-reloaded with `Super` + `Shift` +
`R` (see [Overview → Hot reload](../configuration/overview.md#hot-reload)).

### Development shell

From the ShojiWM source tree:

```bash
nix develop
cargo run --release -p shoji_wm -- --dev
```

Run `npm ci` separately only when you need the repository's TypeScript type
checking or documentation development tools.

`--dev` keeps using the repository checkout:

```text
./tools/decoration-runtime.ts
./packages/config/src/index.tsx
./packages/shoji_wm
```

This means you can keep the current fast edit-and-run workflow while using Nix
to provide the native build dependencies and the pinned `rusty_v8` archive.

### External xwayland-satellite

xwayland-satellite is built into ShojiWM. To run a separately packaged
`xwayland-satellite` as its own process instead (for debugging, or to try a
different branch), enable it in the NixOS module:

```nix
{
  programs.shojiwm = {
    enable = true;
    xwaylandSatellite.enable = true;
    xwaylandSatellite.package =
      inputs.xwayland-satellite-shojiwm.packages.${pkgs.system}.default;
  };
}
```

Where your flake inputs include the package, for example:

```nix
{
  inputs.xwayland-satellite-shojiwm.url =
    "github:bea4dev/xwayland-satellite/shojiwm";
}
```

`programs.shojiwm.xwaylandSatellite.package` accepts any package that provides a
`bin/xwayland-satellite` executable; it defaults to `pkgs.xwayland-satellite`.

## Running

- **From your login manager:** choose **ShojiWM** as the session and log in.
- **From a TTY:** run `shoji_wm --tty`.
- **Development (nested window):** run `cargo run --release -p shoji_wm -- --dev`
  from the source tree — handy for iterating without leaving your current session.

## Optional: desktop shell

ShojiWM is just the compositor — it does not ship a bar, launcher, or other shell
UI on its own. A standard shell implementation is provided separately:

- **shoji-bar-3** — [github.com/bea4dev/shoji-bar-3](https://github.com/bea4dev/shoji-bar-3)

Follow the setup instructions in that repository's `README.md` to install and
enable it. (The default ShojiWM config already launches `shoji-bar-3` if it is
present.)
